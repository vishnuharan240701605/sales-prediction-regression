# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch

Welcome! This project shows how to build a **linear regression model manually** using Python and NumPy — no machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, just pure math and logic.

It's a great starting point if you're learning how regression works under the hood and want to go beyond just calling `model.fit()`.

## ✨ What You’ll Learn

- How to calculate **slope (m)** and **intercept (c)** using the **least squares method**
- Derive the **best-fit line equation**:  
  \[
  y = m*x + c
  \]
- Predict new values with your equation
- Evaluate model performance using **R² (coefficient of determination)**
- Visualize the data and regression line using `matplotlib`

## 📁 Files Included

- `linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full explanations, code, and plots
- `linear_regression_from_scratch.py`: Script version without markdown

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I created this project to deeply understand how linear regression works from the ground up. Rather than relying on libraries, I wanted to get hands-on with the math — and see each step in action.

This project helped me understand:
- How the regression line is calculated
- What slope and intercept really mean
- How to measure how good the model is
